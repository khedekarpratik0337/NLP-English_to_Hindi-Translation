Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly growing field that involves using computational techniques to analyze, understand, and generate human language. One of the most important and successful architectures in NLP is the transformer, which was introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Google researchers in 2017. The transformer architecture uses self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences, which allows for parallelization and faster training compared to traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This has led to state-of-the-art performance in a variety of NLP tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering. In this introduction, we will discuss the transformer architecture and its key components.


In natural language processing (NLP), attention mechanisms are used to help neural network models focus on the most relevant parts of input sequences while processing them. Attention allows models to learn dependencies between words, phrases, or sentences in a way that traditional architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) cannot. Attention mechanisms enable NLP models to understand the context and meaning of the text, which leads to improved performance on a variety of NLP tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering
